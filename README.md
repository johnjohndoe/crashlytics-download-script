This script downloads all the sessions and corresponding crash logs from Crashlytics/Fabric using the Selenium Chrome web driver. 

Before you set up this project in Eclipse, download the Selenium web driver for Java at http://www.seleniumhq.org/download. Add the selenium jars to your projects JAVA build path. You will also need to download the ChromeDriver executable that WebDriver uses to control Chrome from https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads and update the value of PATH_TO_CHROME_WEBDRIVER in FabricConstants.java
